<?php
/* Actor page actor.php: A page that shows an actor information.

1. This page must take the actor id as the id parameter of the request URL 
and display the corresponding actor’s information, including their name and 
the movies that they were in. For example, the URL http://localhost:8888/actor.php?id=4033 
must display the information on Ms. Drew Barrymore.

Note: Any name=value pair appearing after ? in the URL (e.g., id=4033 
in http://localhost:8888/actor.php?id=4033) is available as $_GET['name'] (e.g., _GET['id']) 
in your PHP code.

2. For every movie that the actor was in, the actor page must include a hyperlink to the corresponding 
“movie page” described next. */
